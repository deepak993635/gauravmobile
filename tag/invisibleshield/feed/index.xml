										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered an InvisibleSHIELD per week in the past and it has lastly arrived.  Previous to putting in the pores and skin, I swapped out my chrome faulty cellphone with a model new alternative in order that I might have a clear cellphone with no scratches.</p>
<p>The InvisibleSHIELD comes properly packaged and consists of the plastic protecting pores and skin, a plastic squeegee, and a bottle of &#8220;Defend Spray&#8221;, which is usually water.  A perforated plastic sheet holds the numerous particular person pores and skin items in place.  Sadly, Zagg didn&#8217;t embody a legend, so that you&#8217;re left to determine what goes the place.  Subsequently, it might be a good suggestion to tear out the person pores and skin items and examine them to your cellphone earlier than you start so you will know what piece goes the place.</p>
<p>Set up is simple, however takes time and persistence.  In the event you rush this course of, you&#8217;ll have poor outcomes.  Whole time from begin to end was about an hour and quarter-hour to put in.  First, it&#8217;s essential to take away your battery to keep away from any shorts because of the water used within the set up.  Then, discover which pores and skin piece matches the cellphone, peel it off the sheet, and spray the Defend Answer on either side of the pores and skin.  The water within the Defend Answer prevents the pores and skin from sticking to your cellphone on contact.  That method, you might have a while to slip the pores and skin into place.  Apply the pores and skin to the cellphone and use the squeegee to drive the air bubbles out.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re completed, let the cellphone dry out for at the least just a few hours earlier than inserting the battery.  That method, the adhesive has time to set in.  As soon as cured, the InvisibleSHIELD stays firmly connected to the cellphone.  No edges are peeling up and I do not for see that occuring anytime quickly.  When you&#8217;ve got air bubbles, which you&#8217;re sure to have, don&#8217;t fret, simply let time do its work.  It sometimes takes 1-2 days for the bubbles to clear up on their very own.  I am about 20 hours into my new pores and skin and I nonetheless can see air bubbles.  Nevertheless, they&#8217;re step by step clearing up and it does not look half as dangerous in comparison with instantly after the set up.</p>
<p>The principle tip I&#8217;ve is to work slowly.  Be certain that the perimeters line up appropriately to keep away from overhang.  Additionally ensure to not stretch the plastic out an excessive amount of; the pores and skin is manufactured to fairly tight tolerances.  In the event you stretch the pores and skin, particularly whereas doing the chrome siding, you might have to trim a small quantity off  the place the piece ends.</p>
<p>The pores and skin itself is barely textured and feels virtually cheesy due to the mushy plastic.  Some folks don&#8217;t love this cheesy really feel, however I do as a result of it provides you a pleasant agency grip on the cellphone.  Telephones just like the HTC Contact Professional are typically a bit slick and slip out of your hand simply consequently.  The cheesy really feel of the pores and skin additionally helps preserve the cellphone from sliding round, making it a lot more durable to knock off a desk.  Contact display sensitivity stays the identical so far as I can inform.  I just like the display protector as a result of it&#8217;s barely cheesy and makes my finger &#8220;stick&#8221; to the display as a substitute of sliding round.  One of many large annoyances I had with the cellphone have been the entire fingerprints and grease streaks over the display and chrome.  With the InvisibleSHIELD, fingerprints and grease are virtually utterly eradicated!</p>
<p>I used to be impressed by how a lot floor space the pores and skin coated.  I might say at the least 90% of the cellphone is roofed by the InvisibleSHIELD except for objects like the ability button, quantity controls, USB port, microphone, speaker, reset button, and stylus opening.  The most important influence factors, like the perimeters and edges, are utterly protected and I am fairly assured that the cellphone will survive a fall no ugly scratches or dents.</p>
<p>Lastly, listed below are some footage of the Contact Professional with the InvisibleSHIELD put in.  These footage have been taken shortly after the set up so you&#8217;ll discover some air bubbles.  Be affected person and the air bubbles will clear themselves up.</p>
