										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Sony Ericsson first launched its Walkman mobile phone line final yr, music-friendly telephones have had blended success in america. Although they&#8217;re lauded by customers and critics alike, along with us, U.S. carriers, have not clamored to incorporate the handsets of their lineups. Certain, Cingular provides the W600i, however that is the exception reasonably than the rule. Sony Ericsson little doubt has taken discover of this discrepancy, which can be a purpose behind the Sony Ericsson W300i. Whereas earlier Walkman telephones have been filled with the costliest options, the W300i goals to be a low-end Walkman telephone. Though you continue to get Bluetooth, a VGA digicam, and the complete vary of Walkman music compatibility, the on the entire impact is a step down from fashions just like the Sony Ericsson W810i. We  weren&#8217;t loopy about some design parts, however name caliber was good, and we commend Sony Ericsson for bringing cellular music to the lots. No provider was set on the time of this evaluate, so the GSM handset will run you $299.</p>
<p>To this point, Sony Ericsson has caught to swivel and sweet bar designs for its Walkman telephones, so we have been glad to see the corporate roll out a flip telephone within the sequence. From the outside it is fairly elegant; our model got here in black, however You will get it in white too. It would not bear a lot of a resemblance to the corporate&#8217;s few different flip telephones; we just like the clear traces, the looped antenna, and the textured masking on the underside of the entrance flap. The telephone is reasonably compact at 3.5 by 1.8 by 1.0 inches, so it is simply put in most pockets. It is also fairly gentle for its measurement at 3.3 ounces, however the trade-off is that the all spherical building feels only a bit flimsy. We did not have any issues when utilizing the telephone, however it felt virtually too gentle in our fingers.</p>
<p>Within the middle of the entrance flap is the postage stamp-size exterior display. Though monochrome, it is fairly vivid and shows the standard data, to not point out the date, time, battery life, sign energy, and caller ID (the place accessible). you aren&#8217;t capable of change the backlighting time, however a fast flick of the quantity rocker will activate the show for inspection. Above the display is the VGA digicam lens and a self-portrait mirror (however no flash), whereas the speaker is on the highest of the rear face. The aforementioned quantity management is on the left backbone together with a management for activating the music participant and enjoying and pausing music. The infrared port is on the suitable backbone, whereas the connection port for the charger, the wired headset, and the USB cable is on the underside of the handset. One design flaw of the brand new Walkman telephone connection port is you could&#8217;t join two cables directly.</p>
<p>Contained in the telephone you will discover the 1.75-inch (128&#215;160) inside show. Sony Ericsson all the time does a very good job with its shows, and the W300i isn&#8217;t any exception. Radiant and vivid, it shows all 262,144 colours fantastically and is ideal for viewing pictures and movies, enjoying video games, and scrolling by way of the user-friendly menus. You may change the brightness however not the font measurement or backlighting time.</p>
<p>Then again, Sony Ericsson would not have a terrific monitor report with navigation controls and keypad buttons. Whereas it made optimistic strides with the W810i, the W300i exhibits a slip again to dangerous habits. The five-way toggle is huge and doubles as a shortcut to 4 user-defined features, however it&#8217;s flush with the floor of the telephone and thus takes time to get used to. The flat gentle keys, clear button, and again management are spaced removed from the toggle, however they&#8217;re fairly small given the telephone&#8217;s measurement. Additionally, whereas this is not a nasty factor, maintain in thoughts that the majority Sony Ericsson telephones would not have devoted Discuss and Finish keys.</p>
<p>The keypad buttons are worse, alternatively. Designed much like overlapping circles, they&#8217;re flat with the floor of the telephone and slippery, which made for a number of misdials. Enen extra, they do not lend themselves to fast texting. On the upside, they&#8217;ve a vivid orange backlight. Beneath them are a devoted energy management and a button for activating the Walkman participant, however these are a lot too little. The Reminiscence Stick Micro slot is below the plastic battery cowl, however fortunately, you do not have to take away the battery, to get at it.</p>
<p>The W300i has a 1,000-contact telephone e book with room in every entry for 5 telephone numbers, e-mail and Internet addresses, enterprise and residential road addresses, a birthday date, and notes (the SIM card holds an extra 250 names). You may classify contacts into teams, pair them with a photograph for caller ID, or connect them certainly one of 28 (40-chord) polyphonic ring tones. Assist for MP3 ring tones is current as effectively, however be told that caller ID pictures don&#8217;t seem on the outter show. Different options embrace a vibrate mode, textual content and multimedia messaging, voice dialing, a calendar, a process record, a notepad, a calculator, a timer, a stopwatch, and a code memo for storing passwords and different safe data. There&#8217;s additionally a recorder for each voice memos and calls; size is sparing by readily available reminiscence. Though the W300i is taken into account an entry-level Walkman telephone, it nonetheless comes with a fairly good variety of business-friendly purposes. Inside you will discover a speakerphone, PC syncing for contacts and calendar appointments, a newsreader for accessing RSS feeds, USB cable help, and full Bluetooth for not solely connecting to a headset but in addition for wirelessly exchanging recordsdata and digital enterprise playing cards. And like many different Sony Ericssons You should utilize the telephone as a modem and use the Bluetooth function as a distant management to attach with different Bluetooth units.</p>
<p>The W300i&#8217;s Walkman music participant would not differ a lot from the earlier handsets within the sequence. It helps a broad vary of codecs, inclusive of MP3, MP4, 3GP, AAC, and WAV recordsdata. Opening the participant takes you on to the primary menu, the place You may arrange music by artist, monitor title, or playlist. Settings encompass album/music shuffle and loop, Sony&#8217;s Mega Bass, and an equalizer. Toggling between the mobile phone and the music participant is seamless, as music robotically stops whenever you obtain a name. Cling up and mash the devoted music key, and your music picks up from the purpose you left off. There&#8217;s an airplane mode that permits you to take heed to your tunes in flight with the mobile phone powered off, and You may reduce the participant whereas utilizing different features. There are stereo audio system additionally however nonetheless no stereo Bluetooth profile.</p>
<p>Music capability is sparing by the accessible reminiscence. Inside house is considerably tiny&#8211;just 20MB&#8211;and take note of, that because it&#8217;s shared with different purposes, your precise space for storing could also be much less. We promote investing in a Reminiscence Stick Micro for additional house; our check telephone got here with a 512MB card. Getting music on the telephone is comparatively straightforward. In addition to utilizing the included USB cable and Disc2Phone software program, You&#8217;ll be able to ship tunes by way of e-mail, a multimedia message, Bluetooth, or infrared port. You additionally get an FM radio with 20 presets, Whilst you should use it with a headset, which acts as an antenna. You may set it to robotically scan and program Radio Information System information from stations that digitally broadcast their names and name letters, and You&#8217;ll be able to use the radio as an alarm clock.</p>
<p>For the reason that W300i is supposed for a roughly common mobile phone person, Sony Ericsson included a VGA shooter as an alternative of a megapixel mannequin. You&#8217;ll be able to take photos in three resolutions (640&#215;480, 320&#215;240, 160&#215;120) and select from quite a lot of enhancing choices, along with 4 colour results, an evening mode, two high quality settings, a self-timer, 19 enjoyable frames, and a brightness management. There&#8217;s additionally a digital zoom, which varies by the photographs size&#8211;at the bottom decision it is 4X, however it&#8217;s not readily available on the highest decision. Different particular image results embrace a burst mode for taking 4 pictures in speedy order and a nifty panorama alternative. For audio results, You&#8217;ll be able to select from 4 shutter sounds, however there is not any silent alternative. The camcorder takes MPEG-4 movies in two resolutions (176&#215;144 and 128&#215;96) with sound and provides a comparable set of enhancing alternate options. Clip size is capped at two minutes for multimedia messages; in any other case size is sparing by the obtainable reminiscence.</p>
<p>Though we notice the digicam is a VGA, image high quality was reasonably insufficient. Pictures have been blurry and grainy and colours washed out. Likewise, video high quality was run-of-the-mill. Nonetheless, the W300i does supply a number of artistic purposes for the beginner photographer. With Photograph DJ, You may add certainly one of six enjoyable frames; inverse the shot&#8217;s orientation; and use varied picture results corresponding to brightness, distinction, tint management, and photograph marking. There&#8217;s additionally a Video DJ, and if that isn&#8217;t satisfying, extra picture-, video-, and multimedia-editing choices are on the software program CD, together with QuickTime, Adobe Photoshop Album Starter Version, and a multimedia message composer. Transferring pictures and movies off the telephone is painless. You&#8217;ll be able to ship them in a multimedia message, import them by way of Bluetooth, or the infrared port, or use the included USB cable and software program.</p>
<p>You may personalize the W300i with an array of themes, wallpaper, and screensavers. As all the time, You&#8217;ll be able to buy extra decisions and ring tones from Sony Ericsson by way of the WAP 2.0 wi-fi Internet browser. Alternatively, the telephone comes with a Music DJ software for making your individual ring tones and a unusual software referred to as Music Match that performs guitar chords and piano notes. Although it was enjoyable, it wasn&#8217;t tremendously proficient. Avid gamers can take pleasure in three Java (J2ME) titles, Neopets, QuadraPop, and PuzzleSlider, with extra titles accessible for buy.</p>
<p>We examined the quad-band, dual-mode (GSM 850/900/1800/1900; EDGE) Sony Ericsson W300i world telephone in San Francisco utilizing Cingular&#8217;s service. Name high quality was fairly good with exceptional readability and quantity. We had no bother getting a sign and infrequently have been met with static or interference. Callers reported the identical situations, and so they might make out us below most situations. Speakerphone caliber was barely worse&#8211;voices sounded hole, however it was truthful as an entire. We related to the Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth headset and was met with admirable name caliber too. The EDGE connection was sufficiently speedy for transferring small recordsdata.</p>
<p>Utilizing the included Disc2Phone software program and USB cable, which additionally fees the telephone, we tried loading music onto our W300i. switch time was comparatively gradual at 30 seconds for a 5MG music, so you will need to be affected person for a big import. As an entire, alternatively, the software program is straightforward to put in and exhibited few of the quirks we discovered on earlier fashions. And one other factor, the telephone did not change off robotically once we disconnected the USB cable. Music high quality was on a par with that of different Walkman telephones: clear and crisp, Although one transferred music had some very minor hiccups. The W300i will not exchange a stand-alone MP3 participant, however it does the job admirably for brief stints.</p>
<p>Our one actual disapproval was that the telephone had an inclination to freeze throughout regular operation, corresponding to once we have been going by way of a menu or once we have been utilizing the USB connection. Multiple time, we needed to restart, however extra usually, the telephone unfroze after a pair seconds.</p>
<p>The W300i has a rated discuss time of 9 hours and a presumed standby time of 16.5 days. Our talk-time check consequence got here in a bit brief at 8 hours, however that is nonetheless respectable. In response to FCC radiation assessments, the Sony Ericsson W300i has a digital SAR score of 1.42 watts per kilogram.</p>
