Earlier than it grew to become a preferred shooter sport on cellular gadgets, Boxhead Zombie Wars was an internet sport developed by Sean Cooper. The sport was printed by MEDL Cell, who additionally printed the favored Fruit Blast and Jungly Soar.</p>
<p>In Boxhead Zombie Wars, you shoot hoards of undead zombies on three maps with three issue ranges.
